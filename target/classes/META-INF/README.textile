h1. Simple Routing Example with "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/

This is a small routing example, populating a Neo4j node space 
with a couple of towns using the Yahoo! geocoding service, and 
then doing a A* routing on it.

*Requirements*

To execute the project, Java 6 is needed. To run from source,
JDK 1.6 is needed, and optionally Maven2 for dependency management.


*Download packages*

There's download packages located here:
"m2.neo4j.org/...java-astar-routing...":http://m2.neo4j.org/org/neo4j/examples/java-astar-routing/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
Look for files ending in .zip or .tar.gz
Only Java 6 is required to execute the example using the download.


*Contents of the download package*

@bin/@     start scripts for the application in Unix and Windows format
@docs/@   javadoc of all Neo4j component dependencies of the project
@lib/@     all dependency jars of the project
@src/@     source code of the project


*Run from source*

_Using JDK:_
 Use the download package and add the lib/ directory
 to the project classpath ("build path" in Eclipse).
 In this case, only JDK 1.6 is required to run the code
 from source.

_Using JDK + Maven:_
Checkout or download the source code from GitHub and use the Maven2
 setup originally used for the project. This option requires
 JDK 1.6 and Maven2 to be installed, see:  "Java Setup":http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Java_Setup_HowTo
 With Maven2 installed, simply issue the following command
 at the command prompt:
 @$ mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.neo4j.examples.astarrouting.AStarRouting"@
 This command will download all dependencies which are needed on the first run.
